Description: Provides functions for computing moments and coefficients related to the Beta-Wishart and Inverse Beta-Wishart distributions. 
    It includes functions for calculating the expectation of matrix-valued functions of the Beta-Wishart distribution, 
    coefficient matrices C_k and H_k, expectation of matrix-valued functions of the inverse Beta-Wishart distribution, 
    and inverse coefficient matrices tilde C_k and tilde H_k. For more details, refer to the paper 
    "On the Expectations of Equivariant Matrix-valued Functions of Wishart and Inverse Wishart Matrices" by Grant Hillier and Raymond Kan.
